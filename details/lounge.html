            <h1>The project</h1>
            <p>Lounge is a project idealised by Ambev, a brewing company, one of the largest companies by market capitalization in Brazil and in the Southern hemisphere, with a net income of ~US$2.2 billion. They‚Äôre highly investing in content creation and
                digital presence, and they hired Sambatech to bring Lounge to life: a content hub for all the latest and greatest about partying and drinking. It was an interesting project as it was projected to have many funcionalities, as:
                <br>
                <br>- Interact live with all kinds of content like polls and surveys
                <br>- Access workshops about gastronomy, beer, career, business and behavior
                <br>- Exclusive shows and lives of top tier artists</p>

            <h1>My Role</h1>
            <p>I was brought up to this project later on its development; another team was working on it, while the client was not satisfied with the lack of details in reproducing the design into UI. Management then asked me to step up as they needed someone
                that is more comfortable in reproducing design into pixel perfect UI in a time sensitive context. In summary, my role in this project was to make fine adjustments to the responsivenes and refine components to fit an identical representation
                of the desired UI. It was very rewarding to step up in that project as a reference of frontend best practices, in which I had very little context of the project or its codebase, and still assisted them in making the client satisfied. </p>
