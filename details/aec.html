            <h1>My Role</h1>
            <p>I was allocated in this project as a solo dev, because management needed a developer with good knowledge around layout development - and it needed to be someone that they'd have enough confidence to lead the project alone for a while. After
                working in this project by myself for about three months, they've alocated more junior developers to assist me on delivering it in time - and I'm currently seen as the lead of the team due to experience compared to them; it means that
                for more complex tasks, I'm the one to assist them and report back progress to the Engineering Manager. My work in this project, besides guiding other developers, is being in direct involvement with the client to figure out product changes,
                and then implement layouts, visual elements as well as the logic and integrations.
