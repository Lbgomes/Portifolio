            <h1>My Role</h1>
            <p>On a very similar dynamic as Loungeâ€™s project, I was brought up to it much later on its development. My Engineering Manager came to me asking if I could step up into the project as it was not responsive yet and the team had an approaching
                deadline. He mentioned I was as a reference on seamlesly reproducing responsive layouts, so Iâ€™d take this â€˜helping handâ€™ role to drive a faster deliver of the project. We made it into the deadline and since then Iâ€™ve been constantly brought
                up into projects like this as a strategic resource on delivering good quality code in fast pacing contexts.
